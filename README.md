# Rover NASA Mars Simulator

## Project description

## Dependencies

some libraries are needed to be installed for the simulator to work and connect properly to the script some libraries need a certain version too. to install them easily execute the following code in the root of the project

```ssh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

aside from the libraries used for the script, some are needed for the JupyterNotebook to work properly.

## Information about the mission

For at least three decades, scientists have advocated the return of geological samples from Mars. One early concept was the Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM) proposal, which involved sending a spacecraft in a grazing pass through Mars's upper atmosphere to collect dust and air samples without landing or orbiting.
As of late 1999, the MSR mission was anticipated to be launched from Earth in 2003 and 2005. Each was to deliver a rover and a Mars ascent vehicle, and a French-supplied Mars orbiter with Earth return capability was to be included in 2005. Sample containers orbited by both MAVs were to reach Earth in 2008. This mission concept, considered by NASA's Mars Exploration Program to return samples by 2008, was canceled following a program review

## Usage
make sure the root of the terminal is in the 'code' folder by executing in the terminal

```ssh
cd code
```

then excute the drive_rover.py

```ssh
python drive_rover.py
```

in case you want to record the run you can execute the following command

```ssh
python driver_rover.py [path to folder to store images in]
```
